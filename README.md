# BCI-2018-2019
The BCI team's project for the 2019 NeurotechX Competition. 
  
This years project will attempt to use concentration as a control for various games. The current goal is to create a binary concentration classifier to control a balloon wedged between spikes above it, and a fan below it.  
  
Several Stretch Goals include:  
* Classify concentration as a gradient, and create a player versus player wizard duel game  
    * Incorporate both blinking and concentration into a wizard duel the above wizard duel game
